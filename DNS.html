    Domain Name System or DNS are memorable names for websites not be mistaken for the conventional IP. While computers access the web by Ip addresses. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. This allows for the ease of user experience within the convential web browser setting. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6). The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage. There are DNS servers and DNS resolver and both concepts refer to servers that are intergral to the DNS infrastructer, but they each perform a different role and live in different locations. There is also recursive DNS resolvers which is the computer that responds to a recurisive request froma client and take the time to track down the DNS record. Authorititaive DNS server is a server that holds and is responsible for resource records.
