    Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or HTTPS is a secure protocol that data is transferred over through a protected connection. The alternative to this is a non secure HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTPS uses a secure transport layer security and secure socket layers to protect privacy and integrity of the data that is transferred. This is also uses t show websites authentication and validation. This is important over network functions like publiv wi-fi networkd, because many users will be using at any giving time and that network can be easy considered a predatory environment. For example, consider going to Chase.com website, say hdfcbank.com. A non-secured HTTP will open up. But when we go to the login page, we can see an HTTPS in the address bar with some specific design. Implementation: HTTPS is mainly used by those websites which deal with monetary transactions or transfer user's personal data which could be highly sensitive. Banking websites and web pages where common monetary transcations happen are common examples. HTTP on the other hand is not encrypted and is left vulnerable to hackers and other malicious malware. By virtue, HTTPS encryption is done bi-directionally, which means that the data is encrypted at both the client and server sides. Only the client can decode the information that comes from the server. Most web pages use HTTP to manuever the site until a secure connection is required to save the integrity of the site and the user.
