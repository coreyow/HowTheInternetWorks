    Domain names are formally the name of a website or webpage. It is the exactly address where internet users can locate and identify specific webpages and computers. Previously IP addresses were used to exclusively perform ideifcation purposes. This was not efficient and user friensdly, so domain names came into use to indentify web entities in a more practical manner. A domain name can be any exclusive combination of letters and number to be assignment to a webpage. The domain name can be followed by any domain extention such as .com, .net, .edu, etc.
    Domains are mainly used for the purpose of allowing everyday users easy function of their browser software. It is very impractical and uneffeciate to leave users with IP addresses in order to reach their respective destination on the web.

    ICANN or Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a private non-profit organization responsible for the coordination of IP addresses. Within the parameters of that responsibility the organization also moderates protocol parameter assignment, domain name system, root server system management functions. The private corp. also has taken upon the functions of IANA Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. The board of ICANN was configured by Dr. Jonathon Postel who headed IANA. IANA came of when the US government fiananced an advanced research projects agency network, which matriculated to be the internet. But, this was an US government operation and a global effort needed to be erected in order to efficiently and ethically operate a global based network. Modern day ICANN holds a board of nineteen Directors, nine at-large Directors, and nine to be nominated. ICANN also has the role of solving issues with domain names, their perspective permissions, alternative root systems, etc.
