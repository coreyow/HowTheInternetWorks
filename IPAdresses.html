    An IP or Internet Protocol address is an indicator that allows other systems within the network to identify others. In modern day use the two most commonly used fomrats are IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. An IPv4 address consist of four sets of number ranging from 0 to 255. All sets numbers on a IP address are separated by a dot or period. IP addresses are registered through the InterNIC. These particular IP addresses has three different classes; C (smallest), the next largest is B, and the largest is A. The IPv6 format is significantly larger than the IPv4 while it contain eight sets of four digits and uses colons also. An example of an IPv6 address is: 2602:0445:0000:0000:a93e:5ca7:81e2:5f9d.

    Packets and Routing
    Packets use type of service to request special deliver treatment on a que. Identification flags and fragmentation offset the fields to keep track of each fragment when an IP packet is split into more compact packets. TTL is set when the IP packet is sent off and the number is reduced by one each time the packet goes through a router. When the TTL shows 0 the packet is officially deleted. This ceases the opportunity for the packet to constantly loop and circulated through the system.
    With routers they get their name because they route IP packets across networks us connections between different links. The routers examine IP packet headers while looking at the destination address and consulting routing table in the network. The connections of a router are known as interfaces. When an Ip packet arrives at an router and the destination address is compared with the networks in the routing table. The packet is identified as a part of packet A and the router is out of interface 1.
